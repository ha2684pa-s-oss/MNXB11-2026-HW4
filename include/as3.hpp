// Hint: Lecture 5 slides
// Use lower case letters for all string values in this assignment

// As 3.1 Lets create our own type in C++ and use it for a custom class of
// fruits 
// (a) TO DO: Implement your type (Hint: enum class). Name it "Color" and add three colors:
// red, green, yellow: make sure to use lower case letters for the colors


enum class Color {
    red,
    green, 
    yellow
};

// (b) TO DO: Implement a class called "Fruit" that has a constructor taking a
// string and a "Color" and two methods: "getName" and "getColor" Also implement
// a pure virtual method "getTaste" that returns a string

// (c) TO DO: Implement a class called "Apple" that inherits from "Fruit"
// implement the constructor and the "getTaste" method
// The taste of an apple is "sweet"
// The constructor should take a "Color" as argument and pass the name "apple"
// to the base class constructor
